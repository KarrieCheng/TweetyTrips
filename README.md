# TweetyTrips
##Description
This is a project for CSCE470 (at Texas A&M University) in Spring 2016 which performs sentiment analysis on recent tweets in a specific geographic location. We hope to provide adventurous (but poor) college students a method to choose which city to visit, given current Frontier Airlines deals. These flash deals typically require tickets to be bought that day for flights that are within a certain upcoming date range.

We will:
- [ ] Determine the typical difference in time between the sale date and the flight for Frontier promotional emails (optional)
- [ ] Collect cities that Frontier Airlines provides promotional deals using a web crawler 
- [ ] Collect a backlog of tweets to create a overall happiness level for the above cities
- [ ] Analyze the sentiments of these tweets
- [ ] Compare the happiness levels of these cities
